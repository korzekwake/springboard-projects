## Capstone Project Proposal

Cervical cancer is a cancer that is very treatable if caught early. Cervical cancer deaths have greatly declined over the past 40 years as a result of an increase in screening. However, some women are more at risk for cervical cancer, and therefore it is particularly important that they be screened regularly. Having an understanding of the risk factors is important so that doctors can help ensure that women who are at a higher risk get screened. 

I want to analyze some of these risk factors and create a model to predict the likelihood of getting cervical cancer for a given combination of these factors. This analysis could also potentially lead to more information on the demographics and habits with a higher risk for cervical cancer, which would be useful to healthcare workers.

I will be using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset was collected from a hospital in Caracas, Venezuela and contains data for 858 patients. It includes many factors that have previously been associated with cervical cancer risk, including age, number of pregnancies, smoking habit, contraceptive use, and STD diagnoses. For each patient it is also indicated if they were diagnosed with cervical cancer. This diagnosis is the dependent variable.

I will be approaching this problem as a binary classification problem, with the outcomes being either cancer or noncancer. There are several approaches to solving such a problem, such as logistic regression, so I will try different approaches to find one that best suits the data. My initial exploration of the data will help to give a good idea of the best approach for the data, and which factors should potentially be included in the model. There are missing data points, which will affect the analysis as well.

The deliverables for this project will be:
1. All code, organized in Jupyter notebooks, from each step in the analysis.
2. A paper explaining the process and results of the project.
3. A slide deck for presenting my findings.
